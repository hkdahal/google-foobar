# google-foobar
 A few weeks ago I was looking up something on python on Google, and suddenly a prompt from Google popped  asking "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?". Then it started giving me various interesting and puzzling coding problems categorized into different 5 levels with time limit per question.  I am almost done with Level 4 now.  The problems are interesting. They are heavily focused on optmization. I have been able to solve upto 7 problems so far using right data structures, matrix manipulation, math puzzles, and different algorithms such as Dijkstra, Backtracking, BFS, etc.
