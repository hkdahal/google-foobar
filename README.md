 A few weeks ago I was looking up something on python on Google, and suddenly a prompt from Google popped asking "You're
 speaking our language. Up for a challenge?". Then it started giving me various interesting and puzzling coding problems
 categorized into different 5 levels with time limit per question.  
 
 I am almost done with Level 4 now.  
 
 The problems are interesting. They are heavily focused on optmization. I have been able to solve upto 7 problems so far using
 right data structures, matrix manipulation, math puzzles, and different algorithms such as Dijkstra, Backtracking, BFS, etc.
 
 Only posting questions to show that I have solved these problems. I might be able to help you out with how to approach the problems and come to the solution if anyone is interested.
